# What is an ICO?
DEFINITION of Initial Coin Offering (ICO)
 (*) For traditional companies, there are a few ways of going about raising funds necessary for development and expansion.
  A company can start small and grow as its profits allow, remaining beholden only to 
  company owners but having to wait for funds to build up. Alternately, companies can look to outside investors
  for early support, providing them a quick influx of cash but typically coming with the 
  trade-off of giving away a portion of ownership stake. Another method sees companies go public, 
  earning funds from individual investors by selling shares through an Initial Public Offering (IPO).
 (*)An Initial Coin Offering (ICO) is the cryptocurrency space's rough equivalent to an IPO in the mainstream investment world.
  ICOs act as fundraisers of sorts; a company looking to create a new coin, app, or service launches an ICO. 
  Next, interested investors buy in to the offering, either with fiat currency or with preexisting digital tokens like ether. 
  In exchange for their support, investors receive a new cryptocurrency token specific to the ICO. 
  Investors hope that the token will perform exceptionally well into the future, providing them with a stellar return on investment. 
  The company holding the ICO uses the investor funds as a means of furthering its goals, launching its product, or starting its digital currency. 
  ICOs are used by startups to bypass the rigorous and regulated capital-raising process required by venture capitalists or banks.
